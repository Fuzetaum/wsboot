# About

This library aims to provide simplified APIs for developers to create a new web service. It focus on simple, easy-to-understand and simple-to-use interfaces, aiming to speed up development process by allowing developers to write API definitions in a more readable way, while not need to understand how to actually use libraries to do so.

This library was built on top of [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/), so please be aware that by using this library in your project, you will be subject to what Express.js has to offer, and what it hasn't.
